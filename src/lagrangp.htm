<h3>THE LAGRANGE POINTS</h3>

<h4><font color=purple>Introduction</font></h4>

For any two massive bodies rotating about their centre of mass there exist five 'stationary' points where the force on a third small body is zero (in the rotating reference frame).  Such is the case for the Sun and
any individual planet, or for a planet and one of its moons.
These points are commonly referred to as the Lagrange points.
Their approximate locations are shown in the diagram below for a Sun-planet two body system.  The three points in a straight line (L1, L2 and L3) are referred to as the co-linear points, and the other two (L4 and L5) as the triangular points, as they form the third vertex of an equilateral triangle with the main two masses of the system.

<h4><font color=purple>History</font></h4>

In 1687 Isaac Newton's <i>Principia Mathematica</i> was published.  This encapsulated Newton's laws of motion and
his law of gravitation.  These allowed the calculation of planetary orbits and gave a mathematical underpinning for Kepler's laws of planetary motion (which he annunciated between 1609 and 1619)
<p>
Newton's laws allow the motion of a planet around the Sun to be computed fairly readily, as long as only two bodies (the Sun and the planet) are considered.  However, the problem of three bodies is much more difficult.  There is nothing in the physics of the laws which prevents a solution, only the complexity of the mathematics involved.
<p>
Many mathematicians worked on the problem of three-body motion in the 1700's and even today only restricted three-body problems have been found to have analytical solutions, although perturbation theory and numerical methods using computers allow planetary orbits involving the forces from all major solar system bodies to be calculated with high precision.  
<p>
A publication in 1760 by Leonhard Euler indicated the presence
of the stationary points now labelled L1, L2 and L3.  In 1772
Joseph Louis Lagrange predicted the points L4 and L5 and in volume 6 of his collected works in 1773 he implied the existence of all five stationary points.  None of these works
were accompanied by a diagram, and it is not known when the first diagram appeared and when the naming and numbering of the stationary points was first proposed.

It does appear however, that earlier references number the
points as shown in the diagram above, whereas post-1970 
someone in the space community decided to revise the numbering
system such that L1 and L2 were reversed.  In general the
astronomical community seems to prefer the original
numbering scheme whereas the space community almost universally uses the co-linear sequence L2-L1-L3.
<p>
<h4><font color=purple>Physics of the Lagrangian Points</font></h4>

The Lagrangian points are places that are stationary in a
reference frame that rotates about the system centre of mass (also known as the barycentre) with the same angular
speed as the two massive bodies (eg Sun and planet).  This
is a non-inertial reference frame with gravitational and
centrifugal forces acting on any body within it.
<p>
The five stationary points exist because the true gravitational forces exerted by
both the Sun and the planet are just cancelled by the centrifugal force at these points.  
At any point within the plane there are two gravitational
forces (per unit mass), one due to the Sun (G  Ms / Rs<sup>2</sup>) and one due to
the planet (G Mp / Rp<sup>2</sup>), where Ms and Mp and the
respective masses of the Sun and the planet, G is the
Newtonian gravitational constant, and Rs and Rp are the distances from the point to the Sun and planet respectively.
The centrifugal force per unit mass is given by r &omega;<sup>2
</sup> where r is the distance from the point to the center of mass and &omega; is the angular velocity of the rotating reference frame.
<p>
The gravitational forces all are directed toward the massive body in question, whereas the centrifugal force is directed away from the centre of mass (barycentre).
<p>
The points L1, L2 and L3 all lie along the line joing the Sun and the planet.  Derivation of their positions along this line will be shown in the next section.
<p>Points L4 and L5 lie at the vertices of equilateral triangles whose base joins the Sun and planet (or planet and moon), as shown in the diagram below for L4.
<p>
<center>
<img alt="L4 forces" src="lpbal.gif">
</center>
<p>
The centre of mass of the Sun-Earth system is shown outside the Sun here for clarity.  It actually lies within the core of the Sun, less than 500 km from its centre.  However, this distance is just enough to ensure that all three forces at the L4 point can balance. 
To prove that the triangle is equilateral (equal side lengths)
requires that the three forces be resolved into orthogonal
components and added algebraically.
<p>
The diagram below shows the magnitude of the total force in 
the Sun-Earth rotating system.  Very bright regions signify
a strong force field, whereas dark regions are regions of
weak field.  The yellow lines indicate forces close to zero,
and show that L3, L4 and L5 are really quite extended areas
rather than points.  This is confirmed by the distribution of Trojan asteroids discussed in a later section.  The intensity
scale of this image is logarithmic in force and has also
been allowed to saturate at high field strengths to better
show the weak field detail.  Note that L1 and L2 are elliptical areas with the major (longer) axis perpendicular 
to the Sun-Earh line.

<h4><font color=purple>Derivation of the Positions of L1, L2, L3</font></h4>
<center>
<img alt="Schematic diagram for L1-L3" src="lgcld.gif">
</center>
<p>
The force equations for the three Lagrange points are:
<p>
<ul>
L1: F<sub>s</sub> + F<sub>e</sub> = F<sub>c</sub><br> 
L2: F<sub>s</sub> = F<sub>e</sub> + F<sub>c</sub><br> 
L3: F<sub>s</sub> + F<sub>e</sub> = F<sub>c</sub> 
</ul>
Now the centrifugal force on a unit mass is of the form r &omega;<sup>2</sup>.  However, we can eliminate the angular velocity &omega; by considering the Earth where:
<ul>G M<sub>s</sub> M<sub>e</sub> / R<sup>2</sup> =
M<sub>e</sub> R<sub>e</sub> &omega;<sup>2</sup><br>
which gives an expression for omega of<br>
&omega;<sup>2</sup> = G M<sub>s</sub> / ( R<sub>e</sub> 
R<sup>2</sup> ) = G M<sub>e</sub> / ( R<sub>s</sub>
R<sup>2</sup> )
</ul>
The distances to the centre of mass are defined by two relations:
<ul>
R = R<sub>e</sub> + R<sub>s</sub><br>
M<sub>s</sub> R<sub>s</sub> = M<sub>e</sub> R<sub>e</sub>
</ul>
We can now write the force equilibrium equations for each of the co-linear Lagrange points (noting that the gravitational
constant disappears):
<ul>
L1: M<sub>s</sub> / (R + x)<sup>2</sup> + 
 M<sub>e</sub> / x<sup>2</sup> = M<sub>s</sub> (R<sub>e</sub>
 + x) / (R<sub>e</sub> R<sup>2</sup>)<br>
L2: M<sub>s</sub> / (R - x)<sup>2</sup> = 
 M<sub>e</sub> / x<sup>2</sup> + M<sub>s</sub> (R<sub>e</sub>
 - x) / (R<sub>e</sub> R<sup>2</sup>)<br>
L3: M<sub>s</sub> / x<sup>2</sup> +  
   M<sub>e</sub> / (R + x)<sup>2</sup> 
  = M<sub>e</sub> (R<sub>s</sub>
 + x) / (R<sub>s</sub> R<sup>2</sup>)<br>
</ul>
These can be rewritten as equations which can be easily iterated to
solve for the respective x values (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>) :
<ul>
L1: x = &radic;{(M<sub>e</sub>/M<sub>s</sub>) R<sub>e</sub> 
  R<sup>2</sup> (R + x)<sup>2</sup> / [(R<sub>e</sub> + x)(R
 + x)<sup>2</sup> - R<sub>e</sub> R<sup>2</sup>]}<br>
L2: x = &radic;{(M<sub>e</sub>/M<sub>s</sub>) R<sub>e</sub> 
  R<sup>2</sup> (R - x)<sup>2</sup> /   [R<sub>e</sub>R<sup>2</sup> - (R<sub>e</sub> - x)(R -    x)<sup>2</sup>]}<br>
L3: x = &radic;{(M<sub>s</sub>/M<sub>e</sub>) R<sub>s</sub> 
  R<sup>2</sup> (R + x)<sup>2</sup> / [(R<sub>s</sub> + x)(R
 + x)<sup>2</sup> - R<sub>s</sub> R<sup>2</sup>]}<br>
</ul>
The above equations are robust and converge quickly even with
an initial value of x = 0.

<p>
The values used in the above table are mean values for the planetary distances.  As all of the bodies move in elliptical orbits these values change from moment to moment.  We may thus ask if the values in the table should be quoted to the nearest kilometre, and the answer of course is no, except in the comparison of two values that differ by only a few tens of kilometres.  It should also be noted that we have used a value for the Astronomical Unit (which is defined as the mean distance between the Sun and the Earth) of 149,600,000 km.  A more accurate value is in fact 149,597,871 km but the rounded value chosen is easier for comparison purposes.
<p>
So bear in mind that all the values in the above table are
approximate values.  They vary from moment to moment due to
the non-circularity of the orbits and are subject to perturbations from other bodies in the solar system.
Lagrange himself did not believe that these points would be
of significance in the solar system, but the fact that even some distance away the forces acting on a small body are quite small gives these points a physical reality.
<p>
Note that only in the Sun-Jupiter system is the barycentre (centre of mass, CM) outside the larger body (in 
this case the Sun) which has a radius of 695,950 km.
<p>

<h4><font color=purple>Stability of the Lagrangian Points</font></h4>


The points L1, L2 and L3 which are colinear with the 
Sun and the planet are points of unstable equilibrium.  
They may be likened to placing a small ball on top of a
smooth hill.  As long as the ball is able to sit on the
very top of the hill, it will remain stationary.  However,
even the slightest movement to one side will lead to the
ball sliding down the hill, either toward the large body or toward the small body, depending on the direction of the initial displacement.  That is, a small 
displacement from these points will result in an ever increasing force away from the point.  
<p>
L4 and L5 are conditionally stable. As long as the mass ratio (as defined in the previous table) is less than 0.0385 and the 
small mass at either L4 or L5 has both a limited displacement and only a small velocity, it will stay in the general area
of the point.  This point, under the given conditions, may be
likened to a ball sitting in a depression on the top 
of the hill.  If its velocity is too great it will move out
of the depression and down the side of hill, but if it is
only moving slowly it will stay confined to the depression.
<p>
However,  even at the unstable points, it is possible to set a spacecraft in a reasonably stable orbit around these points.  
This may be an orbit that circles the point.  Stability analysis (see <i>Introduction to Celestial Mechanics</i> by
S W McCuskey, Addison-Wesley, 1963) shows that an elliptical orbit both in the orbital plane and out of it are reasonably
stable at the co-linear points.

<h4><font color=purple>Significance of the Lagrangian Points in the Natural World</font></h4>

The L4 and L5 points are the most significant of the Lagrange points in the natural world because they have been found to be the home of asteroids in at least three systems.
<p>
The Sun-Jupiter system has the greatest number of these
asteroids and they are called the Trojan asteroids or simply 
Trojans.  As of July 2011 a total of 4917 Trojans have been found in this system, 3168 around the L4 point and 1645 around
the L5 point.  The diagram below shows the distribution of these asteroids at one point in time.  Notice the enormous spread, over a distance of more than 500 million kilometres 
along the orbital path.  This shows the region over which the stability of the 
area extends.
<p>
<center>
<img alt="Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids" src="jovtrojs.gif">
</center>
<p>
As of mid-2011 eight trojans have now been discovered in the 
Sun-Neptune system and four in the Sun-Mars system.  One possible trojan in the Sun-Earth system was recently discovered, but stability analysis has yet to confirm how
permanent this may be.
<p>
It was once thought that the gegenschein, a very faint patch
of light at the midnight zenith, similar to the zodiacal
light, may be due to interplanetary dust particles orbiting
the Sun-Earth L1 point.  This has still to be investigated
further.
<p>
<h4><font color=purple>Significance of the Lagrangian Points in the Technological World</font></h4>

The L1 and L2 points are the sites of several spacecraft in the Sun-Earth system.  
<p>
From L2 a spacecraft can continuously monitor the solar wind and space weather from the Sun before it 
reaches the Earth.  On the average they can give about one hour's warning of an event.  Three such spacecraft are
SOHO, ACE, and WIND.  These have halo type orbits about L2,
not just for stability, but to actually keep them away from
a direct line of sight from the Earth to the Sun.  This is
so that ground stations downloading their data, do not have
to point their antennas at the Sun, which is a powerful radio
source that can easily overwhelm the signal from the spacecraft transmitters.  
<p>
It is interesting to note that
the replacement for the Solar Heliospheric Observer (SOHO),
the Solar Dynamics Observer (SDO) was not placed at L2, but
in geosynchronous orbit.  The project scientists and engineers
for SDO decided to accept the eclipse periods that come with
geosynchronous orbit to enable an extremely high downlink
data rate (several gigabytes per day), which simply cannot
be supported by the current NASA Deep Space Network from the
L2 point.
<p>
Spacecraft placed at the L1 point (beyond the Earth away from
the Sun) tend to be astronomical in purpose.  
Examples are WMAP, Herschel and Planck.  These spacecraft need shielding from the Sun
(the Earth partially covers the Sun at this point) to enable
their sensitive detectors to be kept as cool as possible and
to cover as much dark sky as possible.  At the same time their
solar cells also need a reasonable amount of sunlight to power
the spacecraft.
<p>
<center><table><tr>
 <td><img alt="The Sun from L1" src="sunatl1.gif"></td>
 <td valign=center> This is how the Sun appears from the Sun-Earth L1 point.  The Sun subtends an angle of 0.528<sup>o</sup> or 31.7 minutes of arc, whereas the Earth
subtends an angle of 0.487<sup>o</sup> or 29.2'.  The Earth thus covers 85% of the solar disc.  If the Earth did not occult the Sun, the solar power at L1 would be 1343 watts per
square metre (compared to 1370 W m<sup>-2</sup> at the Earth).
However, the actual solar power received will be less than 200
W m<sup>-2</sup> due to the presence of the Earth.  The actual value will be less than 15% of 1343, due to the phenomenon of solar limb darkening.  Of course, spacecraft will not be stationed right at L1, but will orbit about the point, and thus will have access to more solar power.</td>
</tr></table></center>
<p>
Note that all of these spacecraft, whether at L1 or L2 have
to expend station keeping fuel to keep them in appropriate
orbits for any length of time.
<p>
Finally, it should be noted that the Lagrange points offer very low energy transfer points for spacecraft on their way to
and from other parts of the solar system.  They enable new
orbital dynamics for fuel-strapped missions of exploration.
